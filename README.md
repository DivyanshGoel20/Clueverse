# 🧩 Clueverse

Clueverse is a fun and interactive puzzle-solving platform built on the **CORE Blockchain Testnet**.  
Here, solving brainy challenges isn't just fun — it's how you earn rewards.

Players can explore a growing collection of puzzles, from simple brain teasers to seriously tricky logic problems. Each puzzle is designed to test your skills in thinking, decoding, and finding patterns.

To play, users connect their crypto wallet, pay a small fee in **CORE tokens**, and start solving.  
If you crack the puzzle, you’ll be rewarded with a **unique NFT** that proves your achievement on-chain.
